# Claude Code Skills Tests

Automated tests for superpowers skills using Claude Code CLI.

## Overview

This test suite verifies that skills are loaded correctly and Claude follows them as expected. Tests invoke Claude Code in headless mode (`claude -p`) and verify the behavior.

## Requirements

- Claude Code CLI installed and in PATH (`claude --version` should work)
- Local superpowers plugin installed (see main README for installation)

## Running Tests

### Run all fast tests (recommended):
```bash
./run-skill-tests.sh
```

### Run integration tests (slow, 10-30 minutes):
```bash
./run-skill-tests.sh --integration
```

### Run specific test:
```bash
./run-skill-tests.sh --test test-subagent-driven-development.sh
```

### Run with verbose output:
```bash
./run-skill-tests.sh --verbose
```

### Set custom timeout:
```bash
./run-skill-tests.sh --timeout 1800  # 30 minutes for integration tests
```

## Test Structure

### test-helpers.sh
Common functions for skills testing:
- `run_claude "prompt" [timeout]` - Run Claude with prompt
- `assert_contains output pattern name` - Verify pattern exists
- `assert_not_contains output pattern name` - Verify pattern absent
- `assert_count output pattern count name` - Verify exact count
- `assert_order output pattern_a pattern_b name` - Verify order
- `create_test_project` - Create temp test directory
- `create_test_plan project_dir` - Create sample plan file

### Test Files

Each test file:
1. Sources `test-helpers.sh`
2. Runs Claude Code with specific prompts
3. Verifies expected behavior using assertions
4. Returns 0 on success, non-zero on failure

## Example Test

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")" && pwd)"
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/test-helpers.sh"

echo "=== Test: My Skill ==="

# Ask Claude about the skill
output=$(run_claude "What does the my-skill skill do?" 30)

# Verify response
assert_contains "$output" "expected behavior" "Skill describes behavior"

echo "=== All tests passed ==="
```

## Current Tests

### Fast Tests (run by default)

#### test-bounded-delegation-contract.sh
Statically verifies the bounded phase/pair contract across the core delegation
skills, prompt templates, and user documentation.

#### test-bounded-authoring-contract.sh
Statically verifies approval disclosure, exact runtime settings, finite
activation budgets, persistent skill-test and document-review roles,
non-overlapping parallel writers, and no nested delegation across the authoring
and general parallel-delegation skills.

#### test-bounded-runtime-cleanup.sh
Statically verifies milestone-oriented SDD compatibility surfaces, bounded
harness-porting requirements, safe adapter fallbacks, updated explicit-skill
fixtures, direct review/verification behavior, and superseded historical SDD
documents.

#### test-subagent-driven-development.sh
Tests skill content and requirements (~2 minutes):
- Skill loading and accessibility
- Persistent implementer/reviewer pair
- Self-review requirements documented
- Bounded phase size documented
- Spec compliance reviewer skepticism documented
- Three-pass review cap documented
- Nested delegation prohibition documented
- Phase stop boundary documented

### Integration Tests (use --integration flag)

#### test-subagent-driven-development-integration.sh
Full workflow execution test (~10-30 minutes):
- Creates real test project with Node.js setup
- Creates implementation plan with 2 milestones
- Supplies a complete two-milestone bounded-phase approval fixture
- Executes the plan using subagent-driven-development
- Verifies actual behaviors:
  - Skill invocation is present in the transcript
  - At least two Agent/Task tool calls occur
  - Task-tracking tools are used
  - Working implementation is produced
  - Tests pass
  - Milestone commits are created
  - No unrequested arithmetic exports are added
  - Token telemetry can analyze the transcript

**What it tests:**
- Observable implementation outcomes from one end-to-end run
- Final code is functional, scoped, committed, and tested

The transcript format does not currently provide reliable assertions for child
identity/reuse, non-overlap, reviewer filesystem behavior, fix routing,
review-pass caps, or the phase stop boundary. Those contracts are covered by
`test-bounded-delegation-contract.sh`; this integration test does not claim to
verify them dynamically.

#### test-worktree-native-preference.sh
RED-GREEN-REFACTOR validation for the using-git-worktrees skill (~5 minutes):
- RED: skill without Step 1a — agent should use `git worktree add`
- GREEN: skill with Step 1a — agent should use the native EnterWorktree tool
- PRESSURE: same as GREEN under urgency framing with pre-existing `.worktrees/`
- Drill scenario `worktree-creation-under-pressure.yaml` covers the PRESSURE phase only

## Adding New Tests

1. Create new test file: `test-<skill-name>.sh`
2. Source test-helpers.sh
3. Write tests using `run_claude` and assertions
4. Add to test list in `run-skill-tests.sh`
5. Make executable: `chmod +x test-<skill-name>.sh`

## Timeout Considerations

- Default timeout: 5 minutes per test
- Claude Code may take time to respond
- Adjust with `--timeout` if needed
- Tests should be focused to avoid long runs

## Debugging Failed Tests

With `--verbose`, you'll see full Claude output:
```bash
./run-skill-tests.sh --verbose --test test-subagent-driven-development.sh
```

Without verbose, only failures show output.

## CI/CD Integration

To run in CI:
```bash
# Run with explicit timeout for CI environments
./run-skill-tests.sh --timeout 900

# Exit code 0 = success, non-zero = failure
```

## Notes

- Tests verify skill *instructions*, not full execution
- Full workflow tests would be very slow
- Focus on verifying key skill requirements
- Tests should be deterministic
- Avoid testing implementation details
